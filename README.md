# Revo Digital

Sample project to demonstrate how different server
urls can be managed using environment files and `env-cmd`.

## See the difference

To see how it works, try this steps:

* Run the project normally using `npm start`
* Open the console and see the urls
* Build the production build using `npm run build:prod`
* Follow the instructions to run the build (using `serve -s build`)
* Open the console --> There will be different urls logged. They will be used in
  production, not in development mode
